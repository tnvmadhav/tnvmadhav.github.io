        <description>&amp;ldquo;Progress is being made&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;  It would be really cool to stamp milestones for various types of progress. It could be anything from a projects, careers to vacations. Timestamps are often used to plot the beginning of something and the expected time for something yet to happen or develop.
